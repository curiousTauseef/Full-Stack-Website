  <p float="right">The system is activated by the 911 response dispatch where it notifies
EMS dispatch and local emergent care facilities that an emergent care
event has occurred. EMS dispatch chooses a first responder team and
assigns their responder roles. Location and event data is then sent to
first responders as they are dispatched to the event. Responders arrive
on scene and begin to multitask as a team to log data and coordinate
care. Dispatchers and hospital administrators are then able to utilize
event data to route the response team to the most appropriate emergent
care facility. Once chosen, the emergent care facility receives event
data and is able to plan the most appropriate staffing and medical
intervention plan.

  id="smallpic"> <p float="right">This comprehensive care application allows patient charts to begin at
dispatch and carries through the entire care process allowing accurate
patient charting and efficient care coordination. The system uses voice
recognition technology to work one on one with first responders,
improving their charting and assisting in care making decisions in the
heat of the moment. Additionally, the system allows for body camera and
microphone options to record all event data from start to finish.
Individual event datasets can be utilized to assist in mitigating false
malpractice lawsuits and workforce development by allowing responder
teams to assess their actions through an after-action review. </p> </div> <div class="rowfooter"> <a

All software is developed by RATE Inc. and can be modified for use on
any device platform. Software can be interfaced with all dispatch and
emergent care applications currently in existence. The RATE application
is sold as an individual software package and device procurement can be
accomplished through our partner network that provides device and data
packages at discounted fleet pricing. Product pricing depends on network
development, but starts at $450,000 and increases based on development
needs. Grants are available in markets where procurement and development
costs far exceed the budget. These grants are approved on a case by case
basis and require full financial and market information disclosure.
